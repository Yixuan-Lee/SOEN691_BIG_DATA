# Project abstract

The project aims at building a good music recommendation system. Having a good recommendation system is an important factor of the success for the music providers. A data set including audio features will be used by recommender system to suggest relevant tracks based on user preferences. We are planning on comparing different methodologies of Collaborative Recommender Systems and Content Based Recommender Systems. Also to recommend this system with scikit-learn. Our evaluation methodology is going to have a set of existing user playlists and comparing to our models with the recommendation system which is used by the Spotify.
