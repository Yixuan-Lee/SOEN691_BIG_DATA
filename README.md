# Project Abstract

The project aims at building a music recommender system. A good recommender system is an import success factor for music providers. A data set including audio features will be used by recommender system to suggest relevant tracks based on user listening history and preferences. Comparison will be carried out on two methodologies: Collaborative Recommender System and Content Based Recommender System. The most suitable methodology will be selected to use in this project. The system is expected to be implemented with python and scikit-learn library. In the end, the system will be evaluated by comparing the recommendation results of our system to that of Spotify by using a set of existing user playlists as input.
